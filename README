Bi-layer XRR oscillations are given by
$$ \sim \cos\left( l \sqrt{q^2-q_c^2}\right),$$
where $l$ is the layer surface distance and $q_c$ is the momentum transfer corresponding to the critical angle. With $x$ defined as
$$ x = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{q^2-q_c^2}, $$
we can find $l$ as the singular peak in the the fourier transform
$$\int \cos\left(2\pi l x\right)\, e^{-i2\pi l' x}\;dx = \frac{1}{2}\delta\left( l'-l\right),\quad \text{for }\; l'>0.$$

This notebook provides an interactive GUI for oscillation analaysis per the above. The screenshot below shows an example result (layer thickness of 39 nm).
